<p>Honest. Hungry. Humble. Happy. These are the four core values that were introduced to
me on my first day of my summer internship at SendGrid. I hope to live up to
these core values throughout my internship and beyond. I am thrilled to work
here for the summer. I will be working in the R&amp;D software engineering
department. I believe SendGrid will be the place that allows me to grow and
develop into a great software engineer. My two goals for this summer is to
develop clean, usable, and scalable code.  I also want improve my communication
skills when working with others and teams.</p>

<p>I started the day taking care of HR work for new employees. After settling into
workstation, I grabbed lunch with my Sujit, Arielle, Kane, and my manager Kien.
Arielle treated me out to lunch at the Green Tomato Grill.</p>

<p>After lunch, Kien walked me through setting up my environments for working with
the sgstats-hadoop, sgstats-web, and sgstats-rest. While we set up the
evironments, Kien gave a quick introduction to using git ( branch, commit, push,
pull, fork). I was also given a quick run through the existing production code
which is written in python. Python seems like a very intuitive language. The
code is simple and seems very straight forward.</p>

<p>Kien gave a overview of the Hadoop framework and introduced me to MapReduce. Map
is procedure that performs a filtering/sorting. Reduce performs a summary
operation from the Map function. The Hadoop framework is becoming increasingly
popular when working with Big Data. SendGrid uses Hadoop to provide analytics
for their email services and determining billing for their clients. One of the
projects I will be working on for the summer involves using Hadoop to filter
through logs and backing up the billings stats logs. I was also exposed to
Apache&rsquo;s Kafka. I will continue to learn more about Kafka.</p>

<p>Kien and I also worked on backing up a dynoDB to a S3 database. We managed to
backup a small dynoDB to S3 database during our testing. Amazon also uses its
own MapReduce, called EMR, to backup these databases.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will be continue to work on the dynoDB and S3 databases. I will also
learn about using Chef&rsquo;s Cookbook. First day was amazing. Everyone is friendly,
hard working, and fun. Heres to a great summer.hello</p>
